# Trello Board
Welcome to my Trello Board!

This board was built using React and the instructions to run it locally can be found below! 

# TO DOs/ improvements
Due to the time restrictions there were some things I would normally have loved to added but ran out of time. This includes:
    - Tests to test the functionality and the state changes between columns (I ran into some node issues as well)
    - Cleaner CSS files with BEM naming
    - A redux store to better store the state changes across the board which can then hook into the backend for up to date store refreshes
    - Using a better key prop (most likely an ID of some sort from the backend)
    - Proper icons for the + and X elements

### `npm start`
