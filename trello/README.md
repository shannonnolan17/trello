# TO DOs/ improvements
Due to the time restrictions there were some things I would normally have loved to added but ran out of time. This includes:
    * Tests to test the functionality and the state changes between columns (I ran into some node issues as well)
    * Cleaner CSS files with BEM naming
    * A redux store to better store the state changes across the board which can then hook into the backend for up to date store refreshes
    * Using a better key prop (most likely an ID of some sort from the backend)
    * Proper icons for the + and X elements
